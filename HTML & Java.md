# HTML : 
Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

### BASICS :
  - 1. All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
  - 2. The HTML document itself begins with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`
  - 3. The visible part of the HTML document is between `<body>` and `</body>`
  - 4. HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags. 
       - 1. `<h1>` defines the most important heading. 
       - 2. `<h6>` defines the least important heading
  - 5. HTML paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag
  - 6. HTML links are defined with the `<a>` tag
  - 7. HTML buttons are defined with the `<button>` tag

  ```HTML
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <body>
      <h1>h1 Tag</h1>
      <h2>h2 Tag</h2>
      <p>Paragraph Tag</p>
      <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link</a>
