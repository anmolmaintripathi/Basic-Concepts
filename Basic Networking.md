 ### INTRODUCTION :
  * #### Client - Server Architecture :
    Client Server Architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client.

  * #### Types of network :
    * ##### WAN : (Wide area network)
      - Covers cities, countries and continents
      
    * ##### LAN : (Local area network)
      - Covers buildings or a set of closely related building
      
  * #### Types of Network : 
    * ##### Mesh Topology : 
      - In mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via particular channel.

    * #####  Star Topology :
      - In star topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node.

    * ##### Bus Topology : 
      - Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable. It transmits the data from one end to another in single direction. No bi-directional feature is in bus topology.

    * ##### Ring Topology :
      - In this topology, it forms a ring connecting a devices with its exactly two neighbouring devices.

    * ##### Hybrid Topology :
      - This topology is a collection of two or more topologies which are described above.

 * ####  Network Routing, Switching, and Bridging :
   * Most computer networks direct messages from source to destination devices using any of three techniques: routing, switching, and bridging. Routers use certain network address information contained inside messages to send them ahead to their destination (often via other routers). Switches use much of the same technology as routers but typically support local area networks only. Bridging allows messages to flow between two different types of physical networks.

* ### PROTOCOLS :
  * #### TCP/IP :
    - TCP/IP is the primary network protocol of the internet. The acronym refers to Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol, the two frameworks on which the model is based. A related family of protocols built on top of TCP/IP allows web browsers, email, and many other applications to communicate across networks globally. Applications and computers using TCP/IP identify each other with assigned IP addresses, which are a series of numbers that typically looks like
