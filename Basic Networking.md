 ### INTRODUCTION :
  * #### Client - Server Architecture :
    Client Server Architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client.

  * #### Types of network :
    * ##### WAN : (Wide area network)
      - Covers cities, countries and continents
      
    * ##### LAN : (Local area network)
      - Covers buildings or a set of closely related building
      
  * #### Types of Network : 
    * ##### Mesh Topology : 
      - In mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via particular channel.

    * #####  Star Topology :
      - In star topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node.

    * ##### Bus Topology : 
      - Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable. It transmits the data from one end to another in single direction. No bi-directional feature is in bus topology.

    * ##### Ring Topology :
      - In this topology, it forms a ring connecting a devices with its exactly two neighbouring devices.

    * ##### Hybrid Topology :
      - This topology is a collection of two or more topologies which are described above.
