# OOPS
  * Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming capability based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of `fields`, often known as `attributes`; and code, in the form of `procedures`, often known as `methods` or `functions`.
  
### Why OOPS?
  Object Oriented Programming has a capability of programming/coding (more precisely, MODELLING) any(most of) real world scenarios.
  
### Characteristics of OOP :
  * Data Encapsulation
  * Data Abstraction
  * Polymorphism
  * Inheritence
  * Modularity

### Data Encapsulation : 
  Data Encapsulation or `data hiding` is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

### Data Abstraction
  Data abstraction refers to `providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details`, i.e., to represent only the needed information in program without presenting the details.

### Polymorphism
  The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So Polymorphism means `many forms` (Looking alike but exhibit different characteristics).
  Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. 
  
  * #### Method Overloading: (its can application of polymorphism and should be said along with it)
    When there are multiple functions with `same name but different parameters` then these functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded or differentiated by change in number of arguments or/and change in type of arguments.
   
###  Inheritence
